    <h2>LunarWSN (<a href=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2022/all2022/220/>Paper</a>)</h2>

    <center><h3><i>Overview</i></h3></center>
    <p> We present a fully functional cubic sensor node prototype designed
        to be ballistically deployed from a rover or lander to regions of
        interest that might be unsafe or impractical for rovers or landers to reach.
        Unlike helicopters or drones, this system can be deployed in airless environments.
        Crucially, the nodes are equipped with wireless ranging and wireless communications
        capabilities, such that each node can be localized by leveraging wireless ranging
        with triangulation, and a cluster of deployed nodes form an expandable WSN
        (Wireless Sensor Network), that we term LunarWSN.
        The hardware redundancy of the network can reduce the chance of failure.
        Each node is a light (less than 170g),
        miniaturized (5cm x 5cm x 5cm), modular design,
        that allows sensor payloads to be customized to
        different scientific missions. As a representative case study,
        the node described in this paper is equipped with an impedance
        sensor designed to measure the permittivity of the lunar soil,
        which infers water content. With the help of LunarWSN, more in
        situ measurement results can be obtained to acquire meter-scale-resolution knowledge
        of lunar resource distribution and dynamic phenomena.

    <center><h3><i>Design</i></h3></center>
    <p> Each sensor node is an omni-directional design, and has wireless communication antenna,
        wireless ranging antenna, sensor probes, and solar panels on each side of the node.
        No matter what landing gesture is, each node can always have wireless connection with
        other nodes and can harvest energy from the sunlight.

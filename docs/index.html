    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/>Media Lab</a>. I'm studying in <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/responsive-environments/overview/>Responsive Environments group</a>, advised by <a href=http://paradiso.media.mit.edu>Prof. Joe Paradiso</a>

    <p>
        I'm a <b>maker</b>, <b>engineer</b>, and a <b>future astronaut</b>! I love <b>painting</b>, <b>basketball</b>, and <b>hiking</b>!
        I really enjoy building things (embedded systems, electroncal-mechanical systems) that can do some interesting things. I love space a lot, and I think it's a real romantic place. My current interest is Wireless Sensor Network and miniature robotic swarm for space explorations.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I got my Master degree in Signal and Information Processing from China (2018). After that, I went to CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), and worked as an engineer in the <a href=http://ams02.space/>AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer)</a> experiment, a state-of-the-art particle physics detector operating on the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment is led by Nobel laureate of physics <a href=https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/samuel-ting>Prof. Samuel C. C. Ting</a>.

        </p>

        In AMS-02, I was helping with the development and test of an <a href=https://ams02.space/upgraded-tracker-thermal-pump-system> Upgraded Tracker Thermal Pump System (UTTPS) </a> that was installed on the AMS-02 through four space walks (Extravehicular Activities or EVAs) by the end of January, 2020. I developed monitoring and control software by using LabVIEW for the thermal vacuum tests of the UTTPS. We used the LabVIEW software to control all the test equipment and monitor the test environment.

    <p>After a year of work at CERN, I came to MIT.</p>

    <h2>Research interest</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on Wireless Sensor Networks and Miniature robotic swarms for space explorations. My side projects include automatic cuicirt debug, onbody sensors, etc.</p>

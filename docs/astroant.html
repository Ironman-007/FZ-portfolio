    <p> We are sending a tiny robot to the Lunar south pole! </p>

    <h3>Step I --- parabolic flights</h3>
    <p>
        This work is built on our group's past project <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/rovables/overview/>
        Rovable</a> - a miniature robotic swarm that can move on clothing and build an on body sensor network.
        We extend the applications of this platform to space. Since most of space systems
        (space station, satellite, spacecraft, etc.) are covered with protection Beta cloth, we want to build
        an on body sensor network for these space platforms. With modular design, each robot can carry different
        sensor payload to do inspection sensing for the space systems from outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first step is testing such a miniature robotic swarm platform in microgravity environment.
        The test is divided into 2 phases: <i><b>mobility test</b></i> and <i><b>sensor capability test</b></i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each robot has magnet rings on the wheels, which make them able to attach to any magnetic surfaces,
        or flexible fabric with another pair of magnet wheels that pinch the fabric in middle, which is shown
        as following image.

    <p>The model 1 is designed for testing the mobility of the such actuation mechanism.</p>

    <p>Each model was tested on in two parabolic flights (30 parabolas/flight).</p>

    </center></p>

    <p>Model 1 was tested surfaces that are made up of different materials, including
        steel, aluminum with magnetic paint, and Beta cloth simulant.
        We tested the speed and obstacle overcoming capability of the Model 1
        in Lunar/Martian/Zero gravity environment.

    <p> The model 2 is bigger, which has larger battery (longer lifetime), and can carry
        bigger sensor payload. We tested the sensing capability of the Model 2 in
        Lunar/Martian/Zero gravity environment.

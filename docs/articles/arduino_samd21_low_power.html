    <h3>Why all SAMD21 Arduino boards only have one 32.768KHz Crystal?</h3>

    <p>
        I used STM32 MCU before. All the chips I used have internal oscillators
        to offer clock for CPU and peripherals. They can also be clocked through external crystals/oscillators.
        Normally there should be one 32.768KHz crystal to offer clock for RTC and some other peripherals have no
        high-frequency clock requirement, and a few-MHz crystal to offer clock for CPU and other components.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I turned to SAMD21 MCU. I found that all the Arduino boards based on SAMD21 only have one 32.768KHz crystal.
        I read the datasheet and found that SAMD21 can also has an external MHz crystal to offer clock for CPU.
        So I was wondering why all the Arduino boards only have one 32.768KHz crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I read the CLK part of the SADM21, and I found it was a little bit confusing at first since
        it's flexible and can be configured in many ways. Finally, I figured out how it works.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then turned to Arduino source code. There is a function that's called
        after reset before the <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> function. It's called
        <code>systemInint()</code>, in <code>.../.platformio/packages/framework-arduino-samd-adafruit/cores/arduino/startup.cpp</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    here is the part of the code comments that defines the clock configuration in Arduino framework:
    <pre class = "codebox">

    //********************** SAMD21 *********************//

    /**
    * \brief SystemInit() configures the needed clocks and according Flash Read Wait States.
    * At reset:
    * - OSC8M clock source is enabled with a divider by 8 (1MHz).
    * - Generic Clock Generator 0 (GCLKMAIN) is using OSC8M as source.
    * We need to:
    * 1) Enable XOSC32K clock (External on-board 32.768Hz oscillator), will be used as DFLL48M reference.
    * 2) Put XOSC32K as source of Generic Clock Generator 1
    * 3) Put Generic Clock Generator 1 as source for Generic Clock Multiplexer 0 (DFLL48M reference)
    * 4) Enable DFLL48M clock
    * 5) Switch Generic Clock Generator 0 to DFLL48M. CPU will run at 48MHz.
    * 6) Modify PRESCaler value of OSCM to have 8MHz
    * 7) Put OSC8M as source for Generic Clock Generator 3
    */
    </pre>

    Now I understand why there must be a 32.768KHz crystal and there is only one crystal.
    Also this means I can have a sperate MHz crystal to offer clock for CPU and other components,
    but, why bother...

    </p>

    <p>And here is how the clock is configured:</p>

    </p>

    <p>
        In the <code>systemInit()</code>, in the DFLL48M frequency up conversion part,
        when setting the multiply factor, the code is like this:
        <p>
        <pre class = "codebox_small">

    SYSCTRL->DFLLMUL.reg = SYSCTRL_DFLLMUL_CSTEP( 31 ) | // Coarse step is 31, half of the max value
    SYSCTRL_DFLLMUL_FSTEP( 511 ) | // Fine step is 511, half of the max value
    SYSCTRL_DFLLMUL_MUL( (VARIANT_MCK + VARIANT_MAINOSC/2) / VARIANT_MAINOSC ) ; // External 32KHz is the reference
        </pre>

        </p>
        where VARIANT_MCK = 48000000, and VARIANT_MAINOSC = 32768. At first I didn't understand why need to
        add VARIANT_MAINOSC/2 to VARIANT_MCK. Then ChatGPT gave me the answer:
        <code>
            The VARIANT_MAINOSC/2 term is added to the target frequency before dividing by VARIANT_MAINOSC.
            This addition is likely included to round the result to the nearest integer when performing the division.
            The addition of half the oscillator frequency is a common technique to perform a more accurate rounding
            when converting a real number to an integer.
        </code>

    <h2>LunarWSN</h2>
    <p> We are leveraging current Wireless Sensor Network technology
        to develop an easily deployable, and inexpensive wireless sensor
        (LunarWSN) network that's can be used for future planetary in-situ exploration.
        The network can operate in-situ resource detection and surface environment monitoring.
        The localization and communication network that is set-up by the LunarWSN can also
        serve as an early infrastructure to provide position/navigation and communication
        service for astronauts and other systems that working on the lunar surface.

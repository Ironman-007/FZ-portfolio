    <h3>Energy harvesting through temperature gradient across surface
        of wireless sensor nodes working on the Lunar surface</h3>

    <center><h3><i>Overview</i></h3></center>
    <p>
    Miniature ballistically-deployed wireless sensor nodes can extend the exploration
    of rovers and landers to hard-to-reach or dangerous areas
    (e.g., rock piles, steep crater rims, etc.)
    on the Lunar surface. After deployment, multiple sensor nodes can collect simultaneous
    data from different positions, which aids in studying dynamic phenomena.
    To guarantee long-term operations, energy harvesting is crucial.
    When a miniature wireless sensor node is deployed on the Lunar surface,
    one side will face the sunlight and the opposite will be in shadow.
    The moon's surface is essentially a vacuum, hence the temperature on the sunlit
    side is much higher than the shadowed side due to the lack of an atmosphere
    to block solar irradiation in the sunlit areas and trap heat in the shadowed areas.
    This can form a large temperature gradient on the sensor node surface.
    I studied this in-situ energy harvesting approach by using a
    custom thermopile that leveraged the temperature gradient between the sunlit
    and shadowed sides of the sensor node's body.
    </p>

    I designed this wireless sensor node,
    named <a href=hexsense.html>HexSense</a>, that can ballistically deployed from
    a rover or lander to the Lunar surface.
    After deployed and the HexSense landed, it will automatically stand up and start working.</p>

    </center></p>

    <p> When working on the moon,
        after the HexSense node starts working, one side will be facing the sunlight,
        and the opposite will be in shadow. The temperature on the sunlit side is much
        higher than the shadowed side. This will form a great temperature
        gradient across the surface of the HexSense node. A thermopile can be used to
        harvest energy from this temperature gradient.
    </p>

    <center><h3><i>Simulation</i></h3></center>
    <p>
        I set the position of the sensor node at a high latitude on the moon
        since the Lunar polar regions are of great interest for future exploration.
        In polar regions, solar irradiation has a big angle of incidence,
        which means the sunlight is always low on the horizon,
        therefore the Lunar surface temperature is low. However,
        as the node is vertical to the Lunar surface,
        the solar irradiation is almost perpendicular to the surface of the node,
        which can efficiently heat the sunlit side of the node.

    </center></p>

    In the simulation, the thermal environment of the sensor node is set as follows:</p>

        <figcaption><i> The thermal environment the sensor node is in on Lunar surface.</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    The simulation results are as follows:</p>

        <figcaption><i> Thermal simulation result of the sensor node on the Lunar surface.</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    The result shows that the temperature difference between the sunlit side and the shadowed side
    can reach over 150 &degC.</p>

    <center><h3><i>Energy harvesting system design</i></h3></center>
    To harvest the energy from the great temperature difference,
    A custom designed thermopile is used. The energy harvesting system diagram
    is as follows:</p>

        <figcaption><i>Energy harvesting subsystem diagram (left) the custom-made thermopile (right).</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    A lab experiment was conducted to test the temperature gradient formation,
    and the results are as follows:</p>
    <center>
        <img src="./images/hexsense_solar_illuminator_setup.jpg" class="center" height="300px">
        <img src="./images/hexsense_solar_temp_diff.png" class="center" height="320px">
        <figcaption><i>Lab experiment setup with a solar light illuminator (left)
            The temperature changes on the lit side and the shadowed side (right).
        </i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    In the lab test, a 50 &degC temperature difference was achieved.
    As the lab experiment is limited, so it didn't get a 
    temperature difference as big as the simulation results. </p>

    The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the thermopile is shown as follows:</p>
    <center>
        <img src="./images/hexsense_solar_temp_diff_OCV.png" class="center" height="350px">
        <figcaption><i>The temperature difference and the open-circuit output voltage.</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    To harvest the energy from the temperature difference, a custom-designed
    energy harvesting circuit based on
    <a href=https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc3108.html>LTC3108</a> was used,
    as shown below:</p>

        <figcaption><i>Custom-designed energy harvesting circuit.</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    However, as the input resistance of the LTC3108 is too low,
    which will reduce the thermopile output voltage when connected to the thermopile,
    a higher temperature difference is needed.
    To achieve this bigger temperature difference,
    two flexible heaters are used to heat the sunlit side of the sensor node.
    </p>

        <figcaption><i>Two flexible heaters are attached to the node
            side where the thermopile hot joints are attached (left)
            result from the experiment with heaters
            attached to the hot joint side (right).</i></figcaption>
    </center></p>

    The results show the energy harvesting circuit is successfully triggered
    and started to harvest and store energy in an electrolytic capacitor.</p>

    The performance of our approach and solar cells is also compared.

        Manual probing is the primary approach for debugging PCBs.
        However, our hands may not be precise and stable enough to
        accurately place the probes on pads without short circuiting
        adjacent pins, which will cause more problems. On the
        other hand, if multiple signals need to be tested, our hands may
        not be enough. We could also use probe hook clips. However,
        this often requires extension wires that are soldered on the
        targeting pads.

    <p>
        Another approach is using a bed-of-nails jig. To use the bed-of-nails,
        a jig needs to be designed and made to install all pins. But
        every jig is for only a single particular PCB design. Even a
        tiny change of a single pin position requires designing and
        making a new jig, which is poor time effective.

        Flying probe tester is also an option.
        It is precise and fast and can provide efficient diagnostics
        for different PCB designs. However, commercial flying probe
        tester products are very expensive and massive, which are not
        suitable for hobbyists and small companies.

        Here we present the PCB Probe Tester (PCBPT), a PCB automatic probing
        tool that helps with your debugging.
        It's composed of a miniature probing machine you can put on your desk
        and a control program run in PC.
        The program will parse the board design file created in Eagle,
        and list all the signals you can measure in the design.
        After you choose the signals you want to measure,
        the program will choose the proper pads (according to size, and if the pads are
        ICs pads) for the signals and calculate their coordinates, then the machine will
        place the probes on the pads selected.

        This is a new way for the hardware designers to interact with their designs.

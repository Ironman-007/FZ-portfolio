    <h2>99 Friday mask (music louder, smiler brighter!!!)</h2>

    <p> 99 Friday is a traditional MIT Media Lab party which will happen once a month.
        Each party has a topic and Media Lab students will wear costume and have a
        great time on the party.</p>

    <p> During the last 99 Friday, I made a mask which has a breadboard on it.
        On the bread board is a pure analog circuit. There is an electret condenser microphone
        that measures acoustic signal, and then a op-amp circuit amplify the acoustic signal to
        drive a smile like LED array. When the music in th party is louder,
        the LED array is brighter - music louder, smile brighter!!!

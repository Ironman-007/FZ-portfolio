    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/>Media Lab</a>. I'm studying in <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/responsive-environments/overview/>Responsive Environments group</a>, advised by <a href=http://paradiso.media.mit.edu>Prof. Joe Paradiso</a>

        I'm a <b>maker</b>, <b>engineer</b>, and a <b>future astronaut</b>! I love <b>painting</b>, <b>basketball</b>, and <b>hiking</b>!
        I really enjoy building things (embedded systems, electro-mechanical systems) that can do some interesting things. I love space a lot, and I think it's a real romantic place. My current interest is Wireless Sensor Network and miniature robotic swarm for space explorations.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I got my Master degree in Signal processing from China (2018). After that, I went to CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), and worked as a engineer for the <a href=http://ams02.space/>AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer)</a>, a state-of-the-art particle physics detector operating on the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment is led by Nobel laureate of physics <a href=https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/samuel-ting> Prof. Samuel C. C. Ting</a>.

        </p>

        In AMS-02, I was helping with the development and test of an upgraded pump system that was installed in the AMS-02 in Oct. 2019. I developed all the TVAC test monitoring software.

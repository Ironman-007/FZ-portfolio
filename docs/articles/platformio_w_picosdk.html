  <h3>Develop RP2040 with PicoSDK in PlatformIO</h3>

  <p>
    I love VSCode and PlatformIO and finally found a way to develop the RP2040 with PicoSDK.
    Before, using Arduino framework seems to be the only option for PLatformIO to develop firmware
    for RP2040. But now, with the PicoSDK, we can use the official SDK to develop the baremetal firmware
    which is much better since i have all control of all the low-level hardware.
    One thing I'm not sure is if it allows PIO, which is a cool weapon for RP2040.

      This is the platformio.ini
      <pre class = "codebox">
        [env:stable]
        platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git
        board = pico
        framework = picosdk
        board_build.core = earlephilhower
      </pre>

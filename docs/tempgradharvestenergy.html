    <h2>Energy harvesting through temperature gradient across surface
    of wireless sensor nodes working on the Lunar surface</h2>

    <center><h3><i>Overview</i></h3></center>
    <p>
    Miniature ballistically-deployed wireless sensor nodes can extend the exploration
    of rovers and landers to hard-to-reach or dangerous areas
    (e.g., rock piles, steep crater rims, etc.)
    on the Lunar surface. After deployment, multiple sensor nodes can collect simultaneous
    data from different positions, which aids in studying dynamic phenomena.
    To guarantee long-term operations, energy harvesting is crucial.
    When a miniature wireless sensor node is deployed on the Lunar surface,
    one side will face the sunlight and the opposite will be in shadow.
    The moon's surface is essentially a vacuum, hence the temperature on the sunlit
    side is much higher than the shadowed side due to the lack of an atmosphere
    to block solar irradiation in the sunlit areas and trap heat in the shadowed areas.
    This can form a large temperature gradient on the sensor node surface.
    We studied this in-situ energy harvesting approach by using a
    custom thermopile that leveraged the temperature gradient between the sunlit
    and shadowed sides of the sensor node's body.

    After deployed and the HexSense landed, it will automatically stand up and start working.

        The work is still in progress, and in the July of 2023, one HexSense node will be
        deployed to Svalbard in the Arctic area and collect environmental data for 10 days.
